Projects coordinated by CG Fast Track, a learning program for Blender. 
Work done inside this repo are made by me.
If you want to run the files, you will need to install the Blender application. The app is free to download and use. I recommend watching tutorials on how to use blender.  https://www.blender.org/download/
